    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- Decison tree classification is widely used alongside other algorithms in recommendation systems(example: whether to recommen an app to a user or not). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree classifier can fit non linear relationship in data and its key advantage is its intepretability. They can also handle a large number of features (both numerical and categorical). They also perform very well with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree classifier often overfits and it memorises the training data. They are usually not robust as a small change in observations can lead to drastic difference in predictions. They can also lead to over complicated trees that do not generalize very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since this is a classification problem and we have a failry large number of variables, decision tree classifer is a suitable algorithm.\n",

    "- Gradient boosting can be used in the field of learning to rank. The commercial web search engines Yahoo and Yandex use variants of gradient boosting in their machine-learned ranking engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is an ensemble method with base classifier as decision tree that aims to sequentially better the mode by focusing on the incorrectly classified observations from the last classifier. These type of classifiers can learn non linear relationships very fast and are robust to outliers. This combined strong model usually outperforms any single learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble method is time consuming and hence can be extremely difficult to run on a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient boosting classifier is known to fit many different types of data sets without overfitting and thereby producing a robust model. Since our dataset is limited (not very large), we want a classifier that learns from the limited training data and produces a reasonably good prediction without overfitting. Gradient boosting classifier used to predict highly non linear datasets. Since our data is highly imbalanced(the response variable - 2/3rd is below income level 50,000), gradient boosting technique is a suitable algorithm\n",

    "- AdaBoost is susceptible to outliers and this can negatively impact the performance of the overall model. Hence removing outliers should be an important step before feeding into AdaBoost classifier.\n",

    "Looking at the output visualizations, Gradient Boosting has emerged as the most successful model due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model has the highest F-score of ~0.73 on the testing set when 100% of the sample is used. This tells us the model has a very high precision which will be an important criteria in the prediction of the CharityML as it will tell us out of the individuals we classified as earning income more than 50,000 dollars, how many actually make more than 50,000 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The predicting time is faster when compared to other models. Since the model gives a high F-score the training time in this case may be overlooked as 10secs of time is not very critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Gradient boosting is the best technique for this problem because -\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Since our dataset has imbalanced response variables, Gradient boosting works well as expected.\n",
    "     - From the graphs, we observe no overfitting has occured. The accuracy score on the training set and the testing set are          very close which tells us the model has not captured any noise during training.\n",
    "     - The gradient boosting seems to work well for all the sample sizes. The accuracy and fscore are higher compared to other\n",

    "The final best model is gradient boosting that gives us a F-score of 74% i.e. out of 100 people 74 who are predicted to earn above 50,000 dollars actually earn above 50,000 dollars.\n",

    "Gradient boosting is a type of ensemble method where multiple weak learners are used to form one single strong model for classification. In this case the base classifier is a decision tree. A decision tree works by splitting the available features in the dataset into branches. The end of the branch that doesnt split anymore gives us the final decision and they are called as leaves. In decision trees we need to be careful of the number of branches (splits) the tree has, since very large splits can lead to overfitting. This is why we use it as a weak learner(base classifier) for Gradient boosting. A weak learner is one that performs well for a subsection of the give problem but does not do well for the entire problem. For example - if our problem is to identify parts of a flower and one particular classifier is only good at identifying leaves of a flower, then this is a weak learner. It can identify only leaves but not any other parts of the flower. A weak learner must always be better than random guessing where random guessing would be identifying every part of the flower as leaves.\n",
    "In Gradient Boosting, many such weak learners are combined to form one powerful model that can solve the entire problem. Boosting combines weak learners by giving more emphasis(weights) to miscalssified observations of the weak learner. From our dataset, suppose we ran the first weak classifier that correctly classified 90 out of 100 observations, the next classifier will focus on the 10 observations that were misclassified from the previous weak learner to classify them correctly. The third classifier will now add more weights to the incorrectly classified observations from classifier 2 to classify them correctly. Finally, while aggregating all the weak leaners, boosting technique will classify each point based on what majority of the classifiers voted. This way we attempt to classify each observation correctly hence producing one strong accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the model learns from the given training data. When a new data is fed into the model for prediction, it undergoes the same process of fitting different weak leaners and finally classifying that point based on what majority of the learners voted for. Hence, producing the most accurate prediction that is not based on one single weak learner, but based on multiple weak learners combined."

    "Age , education-num and hours-per-week emerged as important features as expected. However, occupation and worker class are not amongst the top 5 features although intuitively it seems to have an impact on the income level. The capital gain and capital loss have significant on the result. My analysis is that a person with a capital loss has a significant difference in income when compared to a perosn with zero capital loss. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
